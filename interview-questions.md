# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a software that is used by coders to run programs. Github is where the programs are stored and accesible through the github site. i would even say its stored in the "cloud".

2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The index is the "number" in the array. Value is what that number is bringing to the table

Daysoftheweek[1] = tuesday

the index was 1 and the value was tuesday


Researched answer: "Index" describes the storage location. "Element" describes the contents of a location. "Value" describes the content of an element

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are like a combination of different data. Strings are individual characters in that data.

same: The count stays the same in both, as in they both start at 0,1,2, etc.
Difference: some functions work in arrays that wont work in strings. an example of this is .split()


Researched answer: Arrays are commonly used for tasks such as sorting and searching data, implementing other data structures such as stacks and queues, and storing large sets of data. Strings, on the other hand, are commonly used for tasks such as parsing text files, processing user input, and formatting output in applications.

I tried to look for this in the syllabus and could not find it so i searched it up.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher-order functions are built in methods in JavaScript. They are a specific subset of built in methods that take a function as an argument.

2. Jest: Its a javascript testing software.

3. Objects: Objects are a JavaScript data type that has collections of key:value pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as actions in the form of methods. This makes objects the intersection of data and behavior.
